# Counter App is a web application built with Firebase and JavaScript that showcases CRUD functionality. When you load it, the app creates a counter document in Firestore (defaulting to zero), displays the current value (color‑coded blue for zero, green for positive, red for negative), lets you increment or decrement with +1/−1 buttons, and reset by deleting the document. To run locally, clone the repo, run npm install, start a static server (e.g. npx http-server), and open http://localhost:8080. Here is the video demo of the app: ## Demo
